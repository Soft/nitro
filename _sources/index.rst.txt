Nitro -- Virtual Machine Introspection Framework
================================================

Nitro is a flexible framework for virtual machine introspection. It provides a
Python API for analyzing and altering system call use of KVM-based virtual
machines. With Nitro, you can monitor what the machines are doing without
executing a single line of code inside a virtual machine as all the work happens
on the host.

Nitro is open source and the code for the project can be found from the
project's `GitHub page <https://github.com/KVM-VMI/nitro>`_. Pull requests
welcome!
